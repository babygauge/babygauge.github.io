just spent time in driggs, idaho and various places in wyoming (mostly yellowstone and grand teton national park), with a smidge of montana sprinkled in.  it was nice to get out of town for a chunk of time and it was doubly nice to spend that time with such sweet friends.  i suppose i could wax poetic about feeling insignificant in the face of lovecraftian mountains, but that wasn't really the vibe of the trip at all! don't get me wrong, the mountains and the place are wild! but the most surprising thing to notice was the process of remembering what its like to share space with other humans whomst i love.  (^.^) cue sappy music (^.^)

enjoy the pics!  was very happy with these rolls and i had to cut out a bunch of nice pics.  if you wanna see the rest, they live [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xxLTJEoaQ1mOOfLBiXQjdY4xupPw63wh) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15A5udlDQIu8uYXdzuN5eJjlN9dM6i7d1).
