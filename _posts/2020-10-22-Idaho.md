just spent time in driggs, idaho and various places in wyoming, with a smidge of montana for good measure.  it was nice to get out of town for a chunk of time and it was doubly nice to spend it with such sweet friends.  i could wax poetic about the raw majesty of nature and the feeling of insignificance in the face of lovecraftian mountains, but i feel the most surprising part of the trip was remembering what it is to share space with other humans whomst i love.
