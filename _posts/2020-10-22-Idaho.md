just spent time in driggs, idaho and various places in wyoming, with a smidge of montana sprinkled in for taste.  it was nice to get out of town for a chunk of time and it was doubly nice to spend it with such sweet friends.  i could wax poetic about the feeling of insignificance in the face of lovecraftian mountains, but that wasn't really the vibe of the trip at all! the most surprising part was remembering what it is to share space with other humans whomst i love.  (^.^) cue sappy music (^.^)

enjoy the pics !
