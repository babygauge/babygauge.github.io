i watched wong kar-wai's '2046' a little while ago, having seen it last when i was ~14.  not a movie for kids!  themes too ~big~ for little developing brains.  its all about memory and regret and longing and how the past poisons the present which makes for a dystopian future or something.  heady shit!

there was a funny kerfuffle on twitter a while back when the criterion collection announced there would be remasters of his old movies: 2046, in the mood for love, chungking express, fallen angels, etc, etc.  imagine people's surprise when the remastered films (fallen angels in particular) were totally color corrected and robbed of their trademark expressionistic flair.  imagine the collective meltdown when wong kar-wai himself claimed the colors were always imbalanced and that he had been itching to color correct the shots.  the present poisoning the past in this case.  to be honest i kinda respect his position that these are "new films for new times" even if the remasters look like total dogshit.  new dogshit for dogshit times.

on that resoundingly positive note, i got a roll of film back that i was extremely happy with.  because i took the photos over such a long time, i was able to get a lot of friends to feature in the roll.  it was shot on fuji 200 which is usually a pretty dead film stock, but for some reason it really came alive this time?  the colors are warm and vibrant.  like a wong kar-wai movie.  unlike a wong kar-wai movie these pics certainly haven't been color corrected!

here they are:
