today a friend called to tell me my feelings are not my own because 'literally everything is in retrograde' -- what a wonderful thing to get a phone call about!  today as i read about the propagation of correlations across scales in protein sequences, i ask why not on a macro scale?  certainly an unfalsifiable premise, but it feels "useful" (i.e. it feels good) to let go of responsibility for the uneasiness i was feeling in my gut all day.

anyway stay strapped out there for the time being, mercury retrograde conspicuously ends election day lol
