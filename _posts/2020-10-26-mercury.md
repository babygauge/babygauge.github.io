today a friend called to urgently tell me my feelings are not my own because 'literally everything is in retrograde' -- what a wonderful thing to get a phone call about!  today as i read about the propagation of correlations across scales in protein sequences, i dare to ask why not also at the human scale?  certainly unfalsifiable at best, but feels "useful" (i.e. feels good ðŸ˜Ž) to let go of responsibility for the uneasiness i was feeling in my gut all day.

anyway stay strapped out there for the time being, mercury retrograde conspicuously ends election day lol.  hopefully the baby witches don't try to [hex the moon](https://www.thecut.com/2020/07/some-tiktok-baby-witches-apparently-tried-to-hex-the-moon.html) again.
